# Numerical-Methods

These codes are being developed as a part of my Numerical Methods course. Some of the comments are in Portuguese.
They cover:

- How to find the zeroes of real-valued functions.
- How to solve linear and non-linear systems of equations.
- How to solve differential equations: both initial value problems and boundary value problems.
- Least Square Methods for curve adjustment.
- Numerical Integration.
